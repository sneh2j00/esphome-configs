ESPHome configs for use with Home Assistant

These are all suitable for Mirabella Genio smart devices sold by K-Mart Australia.

To flash your devices, you will need ESPHome and Tuya-Convert.

Install them both as per their own installation instructions.

I find it easiest to create a new node using the ESPHome wizard, then replace the created .yaml files with these, then compile your binary.
